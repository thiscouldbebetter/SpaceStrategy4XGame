Ascendancy - Ships
==================

Adapted from documentation found at the URLs:

Hull size	Number of items
---------	---------------
Small		5
Medium		10
Large		15
Enormous	25


Power Generators
----------------

"Strength", as described by the original author, seems to be a score to compare the "total value" of different ships to each other.

It seems that the table on the original page is missing a column named "Power Created".  Perhaps this is the same as "Strength", as in the subsequent table for engines?

Name			Strength	Cost
----------------	--------	----
Proton Shaver		2		20
Subatomic Scoop		4		35
Quark Express		6		60
Van Creeg Hypersplicer	8		80
Nanotwirler		10		100


Engines
-------

Per the original author, range is expressed in multiples of the smallest visible grid cells.

----			---------	--------	-----	----
Tonklin Motor		1		2		2	10
Ion Banger		1		4		4	30
Graviton Projector	3		6		6	40
Inertia Negator		1		6		6	20

Scanners
--------

Name				Strength	Range 	Cost
----				--------	-----	----
Tonklin Frequency Analyzer	1		25	20
Subspace Phase Array		1		50	40
Aural Cloud Constructor		2		75	60
Hyperwave Tympanum		3		100	80
Murgatroyd's Knower		4		200	100
Nanowave Decoupling Net		5		1000	200


Shields
-------

Some weapon-versus-shield examples:

	If the target has 3 powered Ion Wraps (3*1=3 strengh) and is hit with a plasmatron (4 damage/hit), the target's hull takes 1 damage (4-3=1).

	If the target has 2 powered Hyperwave Nullifiers (2*4=8 strength) and is hit with 2 Hypersphere Driver shots (10 damage/hit),
	the target's hull takes 4 damage (2*(10-8)=4).
	
	A ship with 3 powered Nanoshells (3*5=15 strength) cannot take any damage from weapons, except the Myrmidonic Carbonizer.
