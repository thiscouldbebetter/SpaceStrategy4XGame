Howdy, partner!  How's every little thing?

Greet.Peace
I was just saying, it's a beautiful day for a neighbor.

Sure, we fight, but even that can be kind of fun, don't you think?

Quit
Take it easy.  Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

StateChange.Alliance.ToPeace
Yeah, I get it.  You do you a while, then tell me all about it.

StateChange.Peace.ToAlliance.Accept
Hot dog!  We knew this was gonna be a great day.

StateChange.Peace.ToAlliance.Reject
Want to; can't.  Gotta focus on us for a while.

StateChange.Peace.ToWar
Aw, drag, man.  But I just know we're gonna work it out someday.

StateChange.War.ToPeace.Accept
Hey, that's a genius idea.  Kinda wish I'd thought of it.

StateChange.War.ToPeace.Reject
No, we're really getting it all out now.  Trust us, this is healthy.

StateCurrent.Prompt
All right, folks, let's talk it out.  Really converse, you know?

TradeInformation.Cancel.Do
Yeah, it's like, it's people that really matter, right?

TradeInformation.Confirm
Any day is a good day when you learn something.

TradeInformation.Prompt
Okay, lay it on us, blow our minds.  What's your bag?
