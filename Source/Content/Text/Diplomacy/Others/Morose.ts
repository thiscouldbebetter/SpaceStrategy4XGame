Oh, it's you.  Well, misery loves company, I guess.

Greet.Peace
Oh, it's you.

Greet.War
Don't tell me, things are about to get worse somehow.

Quit
About time.  Conversation is exhausting.

StateChange.Alliance.ToPeace
Just as well.  Friends are just people you can let down.

StateChange.Peace.ToAlliance.Accept
Okay, we'll try our best.  But don't get your hopes up.

StateChange.Peace.ToAlliance.Reject
Too much hassle.  You don't really want that either, right?

StateChange.Peace.ToWar
On the bright side, maybe this will put some of us out of our misery.

StateChange.War.ToPeace.Accept
Fine.  Honestly, we needed a minute to think ourselves.

StateChange.War.ToPeace.Reject
No.  At least, if we fight, we're doing SOMEthing, right?

StateCurrent.Prompt
Talking is depressing, but so is being alone with our thoughts.

StateCurrent.PromptAgain
I'm starting to remember why we don't enjoy talking too long.

TradeInformation.Cancel.Do
Ignorance is bliss.  Well, nothing is bliss, but you know.

TradeInformation.Confirm
Oh, goody, more things we wish we didn't know.

TradeInformation.Prompt
The only thing worse than finding out stuff is finding it out later.
