Ascendancy Planetary Structures

Some additional notes on planetary production from that site:

	To calculate the score represented in the game, you need to know that the growth is not linear.
	Instead all values in the game can be calculated as follows:

	Total industry is
		the sum of industry produced by structures,
		multiplied by 1.5 if a Hyperpower Plant is present,
		rounded down to a number we'll call the "pre-exponentiation industry",
		raised to the power 0.85,
		then rounded to nearest integer.

	Total prosperity is:
		the sum of prosperity produced by structures,
		multiplied by 1.5 if a Fertilization Plant present,
		plus 25% of pre-exponentation industry if Endless Party is active,
		rounded down as for industry,
		raised to the power ^ 0.85,
		rounded to the nearest integer,
		minus 25% of total population, rounded down

	Total research is:
		the sum of research produced by structures
		multiplied by 1.5 if an Internet is present,
		plus 25% of pre-exponentiation industry if Scentist takeover is active,
