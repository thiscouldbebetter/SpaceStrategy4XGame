Dearest bretheren, how may we meet your needs?

Greet.Peace
Oh noble race, your presence again shines upon us.

Greet.War
Such charming rogues, it's hard to stay angry at you.

Yes, we have taken enough of your time.

StateChange.Alliance.ToPeace
Alas!  Your absence will diminish us inconsolably.

Joyous news!  An alliance is very ecstasy!

StateChange.Peace.ToAlliance.Reject
No, we simply cannot impose so upon your graciousness.

StateChange.Peace.ToWar
You are wroth with us.  We will fight to regain your favor.

StateChange.War.ToPeace.Accept
Ah, the making up is almost worth the fighting, no?

StateChange.War.ToPeace.Reject
No.  We have wronged you.  We must suffer a while longer.

StateCurrent.Prompt
Speak but your whim, and we will spring to your command.

StateCurrent.PromptAgain
How else might we serve you this day?

Oh, woe, must we remain in the dark?  It is only just.

Ah, a glimmer of light in the dungeon of our ignorance!
