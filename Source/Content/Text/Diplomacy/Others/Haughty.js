Greet.Alliance
Let us discuss how you may serve us.

Greet.Peace
Oh, it's you.

Greet.War
We will erase you from the stars.

Quit
Yes, we've talked too long already.

StateChange.Alliance.ToPeace
We knew your kind couldn't be trusted.

StateChange.Peace.ToAlliance.Accept
Yes, you will serve us well.

StateChange.Peace.ToAlliance.Reject
Us?  Join you?  This is laughable.

StateChange.Peace.ToWar
At last, we may rid the stars of your blight.

StateChange.War.ToPeace.Accept
We will extend you mercy, for now.

StateChange.War.ToPeace.Reject
Not until the last of your scum is eradicated.

StateCurrent.Prompt
Say what you feel you must say.

StateCurrent.PromptAgain
How long must this talking go on?

TradeInformation.Cancel.Do
Out of paltry gleanings to trade, are you?

TradeInformation.Confirm
Yes, you do possess a certain low cunning.

TradeInformation.Prompt
How can your knowledge serve us?
